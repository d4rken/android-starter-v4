An Android template project (in Kotlin) with boilerplate and plumbing, exploring current architecture patterns.

A bit too much for a simple hello world app, but a good start for any serious project. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Topics:
* Dagger Hilt (v3 was Dagger)
* Coroutines
* Flow (v3 was RxJava)
* Unit Test (mockk/kotest) (v3 was KotlinTest)
* Instrumentation tests
* Bug reporting (bugsnag)

Successor to: [V1](https://github.com/d4rken/android-kotlin-starter), [V2](https://github.com/d4rken/android-kotlin-starter-v2), V3 (unreleased)
